# 💪 Pump Playlist Builder

Pump Playlist Builder ([pumpplaylistbuilder.com](http://pumpplaylistbuilder.com)) is a tool for BodyPump instructors to create custom class playlists using tracks from Les Mills releases. Creating your playlists can be a huge mental load — use this tool to sort through the release you own and create a totally random playlist, filter by theme tags like “Halloween,” “Break-Up Songs,” or “Easy to Learn,” or simply see all your back catalog options for each track and build your playlist manually. This tool currently goes back to release 89.

This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or officially connected to Les Mills International. It was created by a certified instructor for educational and personal use.
